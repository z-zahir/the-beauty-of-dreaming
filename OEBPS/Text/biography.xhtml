	<p>
	<br />
	Zahir Meddour has a boring life, so he spices it with his weak almost dead imagination and his writing, while being alone in his room.<br />
	He is not ashamed of declaring himself a mental case.<br />
	The thing he regrets much, is he didn't experience much of his young life, he didn't travel much, he didn't meet lots of people, he didn't explore ideas, opinions, and places, he spent it almost all of it by reading coding books, in the hope of getting a decent job.<br />
	He likes philosophy and some esoteric ideas and opinions that he personally finds interesting. This statement is highly subjective.<br />
	He thinks the most beautiful scientific discoveries are counter-intuitive ones.<br />
	He likes reflecting on his precedent experiences, like his learning path from high school to college.<br />
	And he likes reading source codes.<br />
