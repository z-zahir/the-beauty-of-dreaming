My friend, "What are you talking about?"<br />
Me, "Don't you remember?"<br />
Me, "I am talking about that ride."<br />
My friend, "What ride?"<br />
Me, "The ride from Bejaia to Oran."<br />
My friend, "What's so special about that ride?"<br />
Me, "It was the most beautiful ride I had ever had in my entire life."<br />
My friend, "I am still asking this question. what's so special about it?"<br />
Me, "I woke up with a happy feeling like I transcended the whole night."<br />
Me, "And I had just woke up in the beautiful morning while the sun was just about to rise, I heard the sound of the train, and I felt the cold air in my face after washing it."<br />
Me, "And my grandmother prepared us the coffee I like."<br />
Me, "And I knew every member of my family was okay."<br />
Me, "And I was planning a future with my girlfriend."<br />
Me, "And I knew my father's situation is okay, even mine is promosing."<br />
My friend, "It was the morning that made you feel happy, then!"<br />
Me, "Oh the ride too was cool. We stopped in the middle of the shore, and we swim a little, and one of us said, that was the best swim ever."<br />
