This is my way.<br />
My life depends on it.<br />
Hear what I say.<br />
My voices have to kill it.<br />
Dream it, feel it, see it, hear it.<br />
My pain canâ€™t leave it.<br />
See me as a special agent.<br />
Who seek the way out from this strange life.<br />
I searched all the ways.<br />
I hear from the light.<br />
The light of the night.<br />
That tells me to kill my soul that is tight.<br />
Tight from the pain but I can always try.<br />
Try to live a normal life.<br />
The life I have seen.<br />
It was stolen from me when I was fifteen.<br />
My dreams are more real than I thought.<br />
I am not a special agent.<br />
But I have to find the truth out.<br />
What happens to people now.<br />
They want to take my mind out.<br />
I will strike you now.<br />
I will use my best way to slow you down.<br />
I found what you hide.<br />
Because I saw that sign.<br />
The sign is slight.<br />
A woman who cries.<br />
Is it my mother or is it a lie?<br />
Yes, she is my mother.<br />
With teardrops.<br />
I see you crying, mother.<br />
What I can do to make that stop.<br />
But besides my mother, I see a killer.<br />
The killer of my hopes.<br />
What killer? what hopes?<br />
The killer is myself.<br />
And the hope is my death.<br />
