		Prologue

	<p>

	Once when I was twelve to sixteen years old. I wanted to become a filmmaker and I had no story to tell, all what came to my mind is a story of two guys, one with a rich dad and the other with a poor dad and the rich teen had a fancy car and he doesn't know how to drive, and the poor teen know how to drive but doesn't have any car, so the rich teen wanted to trap his friend, the poor teen, to venge his lack of driving skill.<br />
	If you might ask, it's a dry, useless and boring story with no purpose or stake to intrigue us.<br />
	If I would go back in time and tell myself one simple trick to start writing stories, would be, "Zahir, put meaning into your stories, not content."<br />
	I would have gained twelve years experience. and maybe a life and a career in the filmmaking industry.
