I don't know what is the music I am listening to means. I just listen to them.<br />
I don't know what is the goal of the movies I am watching. I just watch them.<br />
I don't know why I study and why I bother doing it. I just do it.<br />
I don't know why adults have so many regrets. I just don't care.<br />
I don't know what is in the mind of the girl I love. I wish I do.<br />
I don't know why I want to be popular. I just do.<br />
