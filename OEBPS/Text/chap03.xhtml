"Teacher? How can I know if I am a physicist or not?"<br />
The teacher replied, "Have you read Alice in the wonderland?"<br />
Then the student answered, "Yeah, and it's a good one, but why?"<br />
The teacher, "What do you think of Alice falling in the well, part of the story?"<br />
The student, "Well... I think it's just normal!"<br />
The teacher, "Nothing special on this part of the story?"<br />
The student, "I liked how Lewis Carroll described somehow the time as motion of the fall."<br />
The teacher, "I think you are already a good physicist. Keep up the good work, and Good luck."<br />
