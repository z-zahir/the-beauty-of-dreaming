Since I saw you.<br />
My heart found it new.<br />
I have to find the path through.<br />
Through the feelings that are screwed.<br />
I loved you secretly.<br />
And you are still in my heart with some view.<br />
My heart grows increasingly.<br />
And my feelings still belong to you.<br />
Do you remember the friend that loved you?<br />
It was me and I was with my heart so cruel.<br />
This friend texted you.<br />
You loved it.<br />
And I didn't know what to do.<br />
With you I am shy, I admit.<br />
I am the guy that I don't know.<br />
But you are the girl that I knew.<br />
You told me this guy is among riches, but who?<br />
Rich with feeling with a big heart and he did it.<br />
He gained my heart better than you.<br />
You know him is it true?<br />
Yes, I know him, but what will you do?<br />
