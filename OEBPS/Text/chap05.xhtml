Yeah, it's easier to run. I have been running for the last half hour, I am running and running and all I want is to get away from what I did just half-hour ago. I am running. My lungs burn, my throat hurts me from breathing, and my legs can't handle it anymore, yet I still want to run even more and more without stopping. I am running away from what I did. gosh! my legs hurt. I don't know if I am running away from what I did or I am running away from the consciousness that doesn't let me be okay half hour from now. I want to be as far away from this place as possible, and I don't want to hear about it for years and even decades or even never in my entire life. I don't want to hear anything about it, actually, I don't even want to think about it as my mind keeps tracking back what I did the last hour, and I am tricking my mind to think about running and getting away from it. And I am still running and running, it seems my body can't handle it anymore.<br />

Long story short. I am running away from the fact I have just accidentally killed my best friend in an abandoned house. Actually, I am running away from the picture in my mind looking at him while he was staring at one spot without breathing or saying any word. I can't even say it. I can't say what I did, I don't want to know that or believe it or hear it. I don't want my mind to think about it. I just want to go away farthest place possible from this image and the fact that I killed my best friend.<br />
